### Aim

Patterns of evolutionary relatedness among co-occurring species are driven by scale-dependent contemporary and historical processes. Yet, we still lack a detailed understanding of how these drivers impact the phylogenetic structure of biological communities. Here, we focused on bats -- one of the most speciose and vagile groups of mammals -- and test the predictions of three general biogeographical hypotheses that are particularly relevant to understanding how paleoclimatic stability, local diversification rates, and geographical scales shaped their present-day phylogenetic community structure.

### Location

Worldwide, across restrictive spatial extents: global, east-west hemispheres, biogeographical realms, tectonic plates, biomes, and ecoregions.

### Time period

Last Glacial Maximum (~22,000 years ago) to present.

### Major taxa studied

Bats (Chiroptera).

### Methods

We estimated bat phylogenetic community structure across restrictive geographical extents and modelled it as a function of paleoclimatic stability, and *in situ* net diversification rates.

### Results

Limiting species pools from broader to local spatial scales Limiting geographical extents from larger to smaller scales strongly changed the phylogenetic structure of bat communities. The magnitude of these effects is less noticeable in the western hemisphere, where frequent among-realm biota interchange could have been maintained through bats adaptive traits. Highly phylogenetically related bat communities are generally more common in regions that changed less in climate since the last glacial maximum, supporting the expectation that stable climates allow for increased phylogenetic clustering. Finally, increased *in situ* net diversification rates are associated with greater phylogenetic clustering in bat communities.

### Main conclusions

We show that the worldwide phylogenetic structure of bat assemblages varies as a function of geographical extents, dispersal barriers, paleoclimatic stability and in situ diversification. The integrative framework used in our study, which can be applied to other taxonomic groups, has proven useful to not only explain the evolutionary dynamics of community assembly, but could also help tackle questions related to scale-dependence in community ecology and biogeography.
