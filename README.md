### Aim

Patterns of evolutionary relatedness among co-occurring species are driven by scale-dependent contemporary and historical processes. Yet, we still lack a detailed understanding of how paleoclimatic stability, local diversification rates and species pool extent determine the phylogenetic structure of biological communities. Here, we focused on bats – the most dominant and vagile group of mammals – and test the predictions of three biogeographical hypotheses that are particularly relevant to understanding how these drivers shaped the present-day phylogenetic community structure.

### Location

Worldwide, across restrictive spatial extents: global, east-west hemispheres, biogeographical realms, tectonic plates, biomes, and ecoregions.

### Time period

Last Glacial Maximum (~22,000 years ago) to present.

### Major taxa studied

Bats (Chiroptera).

### Methods 

We estimated the bat phylogenetic community structure across restrictive sampling pools and modeled it against sampling pool restriction, paleoclimatic stability, and bat _in situ_ net diversification rates.

### Results

Limiting species pools from broader to local spatial scales strongly changed the phylogenetic structure of bat communities. The magnitude of these effects is less noticeable in the Old World, where frequent among-realm biota interchange could have been maintained through bats adaptive traits. Phylogenetically-structured bat communities are rare in regions that were much colder during the last glacial maximum in relation to the contemporary period, supporting the expectation that stable climate paves the way for increased phylogenetic clustering. Finally, increased in situ net diversification rates are associated with greater phylogenetic clustering in bat communities.

### Main conclusions

We show that the worldwide phylogenetic structure of bat assemblages is strongly driven by sampling pool restrictions, dispersal barriers, paleoclimatic stability and in situ diversification. The integrative framework used in our study, which can be applied to other taxonomic groups, has proven useful to not only explain the evolutionary dynamics of community assembly, but could also help solve well‐known problems related to scale-dependence in community phylogenetics.
