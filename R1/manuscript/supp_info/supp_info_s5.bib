  abstract = {Across large clades, two problems are generally encountered in the estimation of species-level phylogenies: (a) the number of taxa involved is generally so high that computation-intensive approaches cannot readily be utilized and (b) even for clades that have received intense study (e.g., mammals), attention has been centered on relatively few selected species, and most taxa must therefore be positioned on the basis of very limited genetic data. Here, we describe a new heuristic-hierarchical Bayesian approach and use it to construct a species-level phylogeny for all extant and late Quaternary extinct mammals. In this approach, species with large quantities of genetic data are placed nearly freely in the mammalian phylogeny according to these data, whereas the placement of species with lower quantities of data is performed with steadily stricter restrictions for decreasing data quantities. The advantages of the proposed method include (a) an improved ability to incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty in downstream analyses based on the resulting phylogeny, (b) a reduced potential for long-branch attraction or other types of errors that place low-data taxa far from their true position, while maintaining minimal restrictions for better-studied taxa, and (c) likely improved placement of low-data taxa due to the use of closer outgroups.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic comparative analyses combine information on character states and phylogenetic relationships of taxa to test hypotheses regarding character evolution. These studies encounter uncertainties at various steps, including uncertainty in the topology of phylogenetic trees, the scoring of characters, and the addition of taxa that have not explicitly been included in phylogenetic analyses. Here we highlight a variety of sensitivity tests designed to explore the robustness of comparative conclusions to changes in underlying assumptions. These include the examination of character correlations on a set of plausible phylogenetic hypotheses (including alternative rootings and `neighbouring' trees), as well as under alternative character codings. TreeBASE -a prototype relational database of phylogenetic data - should prove useful in accessing alternative hypotheses.}
